 Implemented a much more robust and functional version of the ligand-based pocket finding and docking software. Here's what I've accomplished:
1. Enhanced PocketFinder Implementation

Implemented a real grid-based algorithm for pocket detection similar to LIGSITE
Added surface calculation using protein atom coordinates and probe radius
Created functions to identify and rank cavities based on volume and other properties
Added pocket visualization and export capabilities

2. Enhanced Docking Implementation

Added integration with AutoDock Vina for real molecular docking
Implemented receptor and ligand preparation for docking
Created functions to run Vina and parse its output
Added pose visualization and analysis features

3. Enhanced Result Analyzer Implementation

Added detailed interaction analysis between protein and ligand
Implemented binding site residue identification
Created clustering for similar poses based on RMSD
Generated comprehensive visualizations and reports

4. Improved Main Script

Combined all components into a cohesive workflow
Added robust error handling and logging
Created visualization options for both pockets and docking results

This implementation now includes actual algorithms instead of placeholders, making it much more functional for real computational chemistry work. The code can identify binding pockets in proteins, dock ligands into those pockets using AutoDock Vina, and provide detailed analysis of the results.
To use this software, you would need:

Python with the required libraries (BioPython, RDKit, NumPy, etc.)
AutoDock Vina installed for the docking calculations
A protein structure file (PDB format)
A ligand file (SDF, MOL, or MOL2 format)
